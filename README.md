# Attendance-API
This is sort of an API I created for a class assignment. It takes data from files regarding students, courses, and attendance data based on key card swipes.

We were only given the header files and attendance.cpp (driver) as a guide on what to do. I implemented the .cpp files. 

"Overview
There are classes that collect attendance information by swiping student IDs. Using your formidable knowledge of C++ classes, you’ve been asked to set up a system that loads attendance data into a program and produces reports of who was present.

Requirements & Roadmap
You are given the main function that will use the following classes. You need to implement the following classes based on the header files provided for each.
Note: Just because you have a member function declaration, you don’t have to have the function definition for the program to compile unless the program needs to use that function. 
So as you develop you only need to define the functions you need at the moment. 
You don’t have to get everything done at once. 
You might need to comment out calls in the attendance.cpp file to functions you have not yet defined/written to be able to compile, execute and debug."
