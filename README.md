# Attendance-API
This is sort of an API I created for a class assignment. It takes data from files regarding students, courses, and attendance data based on key card swipes.

We were only given the header files and attendance.cpp (driver) as a guide on what to do. I implemented the .cpp files. 

"Overview:
There are classes that collect attendance information by swiping student IDs. Using your formidable knowledge of C++ classes, youâ€™ve been asked to set up a system that loads attendance data into a program and produces reports of who was present."
